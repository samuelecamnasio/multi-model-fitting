Given a set of data contaminated by noise and outliers, multi model fitting aims at recovering multiple geometric structures from data. Typical applications can be encountered in stereo-vision where sparse correspondence can be described by a mixture of homographies (if the scene is composed by multiple planar surfaces) or multiple fundamental matrices (when the scene is dynamic and contains multiple moving objects). The aim of the project is to implement one or more multi-model-fitting techniques and assess their performances in stereo vision problems.
