This is the code for the IACV project. 
To run it on real images run "Main_real_images.py", the input images can be found on the "resources" folder. While this is running is possible to change the 
the min and max parameters of Canny, the program will output the temporary result and, in case of unsatisfactory results, the parameters can be changed.
After the output clusters are given, is also possible to adjust the outliers threshold.
To run it on the synthetic images and extract the performance metrics, run "Main.py".
